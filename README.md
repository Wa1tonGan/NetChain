# NetChain — Autonomous Connectivity Resilience Exchange

> Detect → Protect → Find → Activate → Verify → Settle.

When traditional failover has already happened but the remaining network is
still insufficient, NetChain autonomously buys back the missing capacity:
it detects the shortfall, protects critical traffic (P0 safety override above
any paid plan), queries pre-onboarded provider agents in parallel (A2A),
selects a viable offer, activates a pre-connected backup path, and settles the
service agreement on **Sui** — with Time-to-Recovery measured, not assumed.

**Tracks:** Sui Track 01 (Payments & Stablecoins — escrow/settlement rails,
stablecoin) · Sui Track 02 (AI × SUI — agent-to-agent commerce where the
on-chain commitment is integral, not an add-on).

## The trust layer (this workstream — Person 3)

Trust is prepared **before** any incident (blueprint §4.1): a scoped spending
authority (`AuthorityCap`), a pre-funded escrow holding a MYR stablecoin, and
provider identities that are the *same keys* on and off chain.

During an incident the Sui layer never blocks the fast path:

1. **Voucher** — the Rescue Agent hands over a Selected Offer signed twice
   (provider + buyer, ed25519 over canonical JSON).
2. **Commit** — the Move `escrow::commit` verifies **BOTH signatures on-chain**
   (`sui::ed25519::ed25519_verify`), checks the scoped authority and voucher
   expiry, then locks funds under the nonce. Idempotent: byte-identical
   replays no-op; same-nonce/different-bytes aborts (`NONCE_REPLAY`).
3. **Settle** — activation `AVAILABLE` → the buyer releases the locked
   payment to the provider address. `FAILED` → refund. Expired → **anyone**
   can reclaim (liveness: funds never stuck).
4. **Measure** — every step emits a reliability event; Time-to-Recovery,
   success rate and duplicate-safety are aggregated into a report.

Duplicate-safety (blueprint §6.1) is two-layer: a service-side nonce registry
(rebuilt from an append-only JSONL ledger on restart) blocks duplicates with
zero transactions, and the chain independently rejects replays.

## Sui objects & addresses (testnet)

Filled after `SUI_NETWORK=testnet npm run sui:setup` — the script prints and
saves them to `.sui/config.testnet.json`:

| Object | ID |
| --- | --- |
| Package (`netchain`) | _pending faucet funding_ |
| `TreasuryCap<MYRC>` | _pending_ |
| `Escrow<MYRC>` | _pending_ |
| `AuthorityCap` | _pending_ |
| Buyer address | `0x016dcf7419dcd6561a7f00ad0a7487fa73a67e336f618d032078282722409e24` |

Localnet addresses: `.sui/config.localnet.json`.

## Quick start

Prereqs: Node ≥ 20, [Sui CLI](https://docs.sui.io/guides/developer/getting-started/sui-install) on PATH or at `%USERPROFILE%/sui-cli/sui.exe`.

```bash
npm install

# Persons 1+2 contracts + Person 3 offline tests
npm test

# Move unit tests (13): idempotent commit, replay abort, bad signature,
# expiry, settle-twice, refund, permissionless reclaim, authority limits
sui move test --path move

# One command, full story (localnet): readiness → on-chain commit →
# duplicate-block → settlement → FAILED refund → failover takeover → TTR
sui start --with-faucet --force-regenesis &   # terminal 2: localnet
npm run demo:sui

# Reliability battery → events/reliability-report.{json,md}
npm run harness:sui

# Testnet (acceptance: ≥1 commitment + ≥1 settlement on testnet)
SUI_NETWORK=testnet npm run sui:setup
SUI_NETWORK=testnet npm run demo:sui
SUI_NETWORK=testnet npm run harness:sui
```

Trust CLI: `npm run trust -- commit <selected-offer.json> | activation <id> AVAILABLE|FAILED | reclaim <nonce> | status <id>`.
Optional HTTP face: `npm run trust:server` (port 8200, SSE at `/v1/events`).

## Why Sui (and not an add-on)

- **On-chain verification:** the Move contract itself checks the agent
  market's ed25519 signatures before any fund moves — the commitment is
  only as valid as the negotiation that produced it.
- **Idempotency as a chain property:** the nonce table makes duplicate
  settlement impossible even with crashing/retrying clients.
- **Asset-agnostic rails:** escrow is generic `Coin<T>`; the demo runs on
  MYRC (1 unit = 1 MYR). A regulated MYR stablecoin (e.g. BloX MYRC — today
  EVM/Solana/Base only) or USDC is a type-argument change, not a contract
  change.
- **Programmable transaction blocks:** readiness (mint + fund + authority)
  is a single setup transaction before any incident exists.
